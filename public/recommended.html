                <p>
                  Indica strains are generally the most commonly used for medicinal purposes. This is because it
                  primarily affects the body, and it can be instrumental in providing pain relief and reducing
                  inflammation. It can also be used to improve your sleep, and it has been used in many states where
                  medical cannabis is legal to help people who have trouble sleeping.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Users can expect a relaxing and calming effect. It can also make users sleepy (hence why it is given
                  to people who have trouble sleeping) and hungry (it can be used to increase your appetite). Indica
                  strains are typically seen as being more suitable for nighttime use. This is because it is more
                  relaxing than its sativa counterpart, which offers a more invigorating effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indica strains are generally high in CBD. CBD is non-psychoactive, meaning that users will not get
                  “high” from it. It is also what allows it to have so many medical uses since it instead offers
                  therapeutic effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some examples of the top Indica strains include Purple Haze, Northern Lights, and Granddaddy Purple.

                <h5 class="card-title">Cannabis Sativa</h5>
                <p>
                  The sativa plant offers a more heady experience than its indica counterpart. Sativa is often
                  described as uplifting and energising and is said to be excellent for boosting creativity. As such,
                  it can also be very effective at combating low mood and attention disorders. Furthermore, the
                  energizing effects of sativa strains mean that it is said by many to be great for morning or
                  afternoon use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, sativa is typically high in THC (which gets users “high”), and so, unlike indica strains,
                  which have a more balanced level of CBD (which has therapeutic effects), it isn’t often prescribed
                  medically and is more commonly used recreationally. It can sometimes be used to combat the problems
                  mentioned in the previous paragraph, and it is still used in Ayurveda medicine.

                <h5 class="card-title">Cannabis Ruderalis</h5>
                <p>
                  The Cannabis ruderalis plant is less common than its sativa and indica cousins, and it’s most likely
                  the one you’re the least familiar with. The plant generally reaches a maximum height of two feet
                  tall, but its leaves and branches tend to be quite dense, which gives the ruderalis plant a bushy
                  appearance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The plant is mainly grown up north because its flowering cycle begins early. Since the cold season
                  hits earlier in the north, it is the ideal choice for many growers. Modern ruderalis hybrids usually
                  begin to flower between 21 and 30 days after the seeds have been planted, regardless of the light
                  cycle. This is why most ruderalis hybrids are attributed as “autoflowering” strains.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It isn’t as popular as sativa or indica because it lacks the same psychotropic effects found in those
                  plants. This is mainly because it has naturally low concentrations of THC. It is often used by
                  breeders and cultivators looking for a genetic source for marijuana hybrids, because of its ability
                  to grow in colder climates and its “autoflowering” qualities.
